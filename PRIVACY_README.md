# FocusedMind - Privacy & Transparency

## üîí Your Privacy Matters

FocusedMind is designed with privacy as a core principle. Here's exactly what the extension does with your data:

### What We Access

**Website URLs Only**: FocusedMind reads the URLs of websites you visit to determine if they should be blocked during focus sessions.

### Why We Need URL Access

‚úÖ **Block distracting sites** - Check if current website matches your blocked categories  
‚úÖ **Apply custom rules** - Block specific URLs you've added to your custom list  
‚úÖ **Whitelist mode** - Allow only specific sites when in whitelist mode  
‚úÖ **Track effectiveness** - Count distractions to show session efficiency

### What We DON'T Do

‚ùå **No data collection** - We don't collect, store, or transmit personal data  
‚ùå **No browsing history** - We don't track or remember what sites you visit  
‚ùå **No external servers** - All data stays on your device  
‚ùå **No analytics** - No usage tracking or behavioral analysis  
‚ùå **No third parties** - No data sharing with any external services

### Data Storage

- **100% Local**: All preferences, session data, and settings are stored locally using Chrome's storage API
- **No Cloud Sync**: Your data never leaves your device
- **Easy Removal**: Uninstalling the extension removes all data
