# Security Improvements - FocusedMind v1.0.3

## Enhanced Safe Browsing Compliance

This version addresses Chrome's "Enhanced Safe Browsing" warnings by implementing significant security improvements while maintaining all core functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Reduced Permissions**

**Before:**

```json
"permissions": ["tabs", "storage", "activeTab", "scripting"]
```

**After:**

```json
"permissions": ["storage", "activeTab"]
```

- ❌ Removed `tabs` permission (no longer query all open tabs)
- ❌ Removed `scripting` permission (no longer inject scripts dynamically)

### 2. **Restricted Host Permissions**

**Before:**

```json
"host_permissions": ["<all_urls>"]
```

**After:**

```json
"host_permissions": ["http://*/*", "https://*/*"]
```

- ✅ More specific URL patterns instead of the overly broad `<all_urls>`
- ✅ Only covers HTTP/HTTPS sites (excludes chrome://, file://, etc.)

### 3. **Content Script Restrictions**

**Before:**

```json
"matches": ["<all_urls>"]
```

**After:**

```json
"matches": ["http://*/*", "https://*/*"]
```

- ✅ Content script only runs on web pages, not internal browser pages
- ✅ Maintains `"all_frames": false` for iframe protection

### 4. **Removed Dynamic Script Injection**

**Before:**

- Background script could inject scripts into any tab
- Used `chrome.scripting.executeScript()` to manipulate tabs
- Queried all open tabs with `chrome.tabs.query()`

**After:**

- ✅ No dynamic script injection
- ✅ Uses declarative content scripts only
- ✅ Uses storage events for communication instead of direct tab manipulation

### 5. **Improved Communication Pattern**

**Before:**

- Background script directly accessed and modified tab content
- Required broad scripting permissions

**After:**

- ✅ Uses `chrome.storage.onChanged` events for communication
- ✅ Content scripts listen for storage changes instead of direct messages
- ✅ More secure and privacy-preserving architecture

## Functionality Preserved

✅ **All core features remain functional:**

- Website blocking by category and custom URLs
- Focus session tracking and completion
- Distraction counting and efficiency ratings
- Whitelist mode for allowed sites
- Session completion and motivational messages
- Automatic overlay injection and removal
- Incognito mode support

## Security Benefits

1. **Reduced Attack Surface**: Fewer permissions mean less potential for exploitation
2. **Privacy Protection**: No longer accesses all browser tabs
3. **Enhanced Trust**: Complies with Chrome's Enhanced Safe Browsing standards
4. **Future-Proof**: Uses recommended extension architecture patterns

## Testing Recommendations

Before deployment, test these scenarios:

1. Start/stop focus sessions
2. Website blocking across different categories
3. Session completion (both manual and automatic)
4. Whitelist mode functionality
5. Incognito browsing support
6. Multiple tabs with blocked/allowed content

The extension should now install without Enhanced Safe Browsing warnings while maintaining all productivity features.
